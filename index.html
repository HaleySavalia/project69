        A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are accessible for use and not just for display purposes. A library provides physical (hard copies) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed materials which can be borrowed, or for reference only (books, documents and other physical publications which are not permitted to leave the library and can only be viewed inside the library) and other physical resources in many formats, such as commercial releases of films, television programmes, other video recordings, radio, music and audio recordings on DVD, Blu-ray, CD and cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.
